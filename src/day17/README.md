## Info

Task description: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17)

### Part 1

Mostly about modeling the Cave system. I used an array of points to represent a rock moving and the rest is to run the simulation and get the required details.

### Part 2

It is not practical to run the simulation for the large input. So we have to find a pattern and then find the cycles. Pattern is identified when the same rock and the move pattern repeats.
